            <h2>Splash Bros</h2>
            <p>The Splash Bros don’t miss,it’s just science at this point. When the game’s on the line, Steph and Klay show up like clockwork, making clutch shots look smoother than a fresh fade. One second you're up 10, the next they're splashing threes from another zip code like it's light work. They make chaos look calm, pressure look fun, and defenders look lost. Honestly, what would basketball even be without Klay’s cool confidence and Steph’s magical handles? The league should be grateful they only come as a pair, because together, they make the biggest splash in the game feel effortless.</p>
